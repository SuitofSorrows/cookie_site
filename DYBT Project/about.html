            <p>Say hello to Suzanne, my amazing mother. For years she has been crafting specialty desserts for all sorts of parties, weddings, holidays, you name it! The big joke is that whenever our family arrives to an event, the first thing someone says to my mom isn't "Hello." Instead, people flock to her and ask "Did you bring the cookies?!"</p>
            <p>One summer night, after years of this positive feedback, I had the brilliant idea to share my mom's exceptional baking with more than just our friends and family. Funny thing is, the cookies didn't have a name, they were just called "the cookies." It didn't take long to agree on a name for everything. This story is how the "Did You Bring The" brand was formed. Now everyone can enjoy all of the cookies, pastries, and cakes my mom has been making since I was a kid.</p>
            <p>So the next time you go to a party, work event, or just bring some dessert home to the family, you may be the one who finds themselves on the receiving end of the question "Did you bring the cookies?"</p>
